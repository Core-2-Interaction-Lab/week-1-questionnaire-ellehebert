<div 
    class="text1">Now here is something really interesting (to me), something you can use at a standing-up-only party when everyone is tired of hearing there are one million three-thousand-two-hundred-ninety-five words used by the Esimo for snow. This is what Ezra Pound learned from Ernest Fenollosa: Some languages are so constructed—English among them—that we each only really speak one sentence in our lifetime. That sentence begins with your first words, toddling around the kitchen, and ends with your last words right before you step into the limousine, or in a nursing home, the night-duty attendant vaguely on hand. Or, if you are blessed, they are heard by someone who knows you and loves you and will be sorry to hear the sentence end.

    When I told Mr. Angel about the lifelong sentence, he said: “That’s a lot of semicolons!” he is absolutely right; the sentence would be unwieldy and awkward and resemble the novel of a savant, but the next time you use a semicolon (which, by the way, is the least-used mark of punctuation in all of poetry) you should stop and be thankful that there exists this little thing, invented by a human being—an Italian as a matter of fact—that allows us to go on and keep on connecting speech that for all apparent purposes is unrelated.
    
    You might say a poem is a semicolon, a living semicolon, (large semicolon on page) what connects the first line to the last, the act of keeping together that whose nature is to fly apart. 
</div>

<div 
    class="text2">Between the first and last lines there exists—a poem—and if it were not for the poem that intervenes, the first and last lines of a poem would not speak to each other.
</div>

<div 
    class="text3">I will tell you what I miss:
</div>

<div 
    class="text4">I miss watching a movie and at the end, huge scrolled words come on the screen and say:
</div>

<div 
    class="text5">The End
</div>

<div 
    class="text6">I miss finishing a novel and there on the last page, at a discrete distance from the last words of the last sentence, are the dark letters spelling
</div>

<div 
    class="text7">The End
</div>

<div 
    class="text8">It was its own thrill. I didn’t ignore them, I read them, even if only silently, with a deep sense of feeling:
</div>

<div 
    class="text9">both the feeling of being replete, a feeling of satisfaction, and the feeling of loss, the sadness of having finished the book.
</div>

<div 
    class="text10">I have never, in my life, read a poem that ended with the words The End. Why is that, I wonder. I think perhaps the brevity of poems compared to novels makes one feel that there has been no great sustenance of energy, no marathon worthy of pulling tape across the finish line. And then I found a poem of mine that I had carefully written by hand in the sixth grade, and at the bottom of the page, in India ink, beautifully apart from the rest of the text, were the words The End. And I realized children very often denote the end because it is indeed a great achievement for them to have written anything, and they are completely unaware of the number of stories and poems that have already been written; they know some, of course, but have not yet found out the extent to which they are not the only persons residing on the planet. And so they sign their poems and stories like kings.

<div 
    class="text11">Which is a wonderful thing.
