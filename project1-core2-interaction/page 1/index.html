    <div class="item3b">The number of beginnings so far exceeds the number of endings that we cannot even conceive of it.

    <div class="item4">Paul Valéry, the French poet and thinker, once said thatno poem is ever ended, that every poem is merely abandoned. This saying is also attributed to Stéphane Mallarmé, for where quotations begin is in a cloud.</div>
</div>

<div class="grid-container5">
    <div class="item5">Paul Valéry also described his perception of first lines so vividly, and to my mind so accurately, that i have never forgotten it: the opening line of a poem, he said, is like finding a fruit on the ground, a piece of fallen fruit you have never seen before, and the poet’s task is to create the tre from which such a fruit would fall. In the beginning was the Word. Western civilization rests upon those words. And yet there is a lively group of thinkers who believe that in the beginning was the act, that nothing can precede action.</div>
    <div class="item5b">No breath before act, no thought before act, no pervasive love before some kind of act. I believe the poem is an act of the mind.</div>
</div>

<div class="grid-container6">
    <div class="item6">I think it is easier to talk about the end of a poem than it is to talk about its beginning. Because the poem ends on the page, but it begins off the page, it begins in the mind. The mind acts, the mind wills a poem, often against our own will; somehow this happens, somehow a poem gets written in the middle of a chaotic holiday party that has just run out of ice, and it's your house. </div>
    <div class="item6b">An act of the mind. </div>
    <div class="item6c">To move, to make happen, to make manifest. Be an act of Congress. A state of real existence rather than possibility. And poets love possibility! They love to wonder and explore. Hard lot! But the poem, no matter how full of possibility, has to exist!  </div>
