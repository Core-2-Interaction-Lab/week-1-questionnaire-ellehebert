    <div class="item3">Creating this website that focuses on women word artists, I wanted to promote and recognize women's work in the art field. I wanted to provide a platform to showcase the work of women writers, both established and emerging. Additionally, the website could serves as a collection that amplifies the voices of women artists who have traditionally been marginalized. Focusing on women word artists is an important step towards creating a more inclusive and equitable literary art landscape, and could  help to raise awareness of the talent and creativity of women artists.
