        The greatest political slogans of the 20th century are easily remembered, as are the most iconic images. These are remnants of American life in a rapidly changing century that will be remembered in our collective consciousness, documented by historians and shifting meanings to fit new eras. A group of female artists in the latter half of the 20th century understood the enduring power of both text and image. Creatives such as Barbara Kruger and Jenny Holzer used text-based art as a form of activism, combining it with images to support the discourse they aimed to spark. <br> <br>
        They gave viewers a new idea of what contemporary art could be, both aesthetically and in terms of content. Use of text was a primary way this was accomplished, along with the force of advertising in American society and rapid technological development. Female pop artists use their art to take ownership over the issues they care about, inspiring other impacted people to take up the cause while backed by recognizable works of art. A major part of what makes female pop art so compelling is its use of text. Though each artist uses text differently, they each make it a central way that they practice aesthetic excellence and communicate socio political messages. Corita Kent illustrated this technique perfectly by carefully selecting imagery, lettering, and text from everyday life. This included street signs, newspapers, packaging, and advertising that she worked into her art to make a variety of new messages. A commentary on the daily existences of people, including the media they consume and goods they buy, is established through these methods. The recognizability of the words she chose and the political messages she layered on them make her artistic voice distinct and moving. Barbara Kruger is another prime example to study when looking at text in female pop art; few artists have been able to use text as effectively as her. <br> <br>
        Both Kruger’s font and the content of her text is simple, but that is exactly what makes it impactful. It is not over-stimulating, causing viewers to focus on what Kruger wants them to take from her pieces. The bold colors strengthen the visual component of the written message. The words Holzer uses in her work define her artistic voice and are cohesive with her visuals. Focusing on making a political statement, commenting on feminism, criticizing mainstream culture, simply stringing together beautiful words: all can be effective in their own way, but each comes with its own aesthetic upsides and challenges. Color, pattern, and composition are all to be considered as an artist decides how they want to visually represent or support the written word, but Kruger finds a balance between the two. Text becomes even more poignant when it rises above the realm of the 2D and becomes immersive. Kruger executed this perfectly in a 1991 exhibition. If viewers did not understand or relate to Kruger’s message on paper, they were more likely to once the work surrounds them and thus appears more approachable and relevant. Becoming one with a piece has a whole new effect on a viewer, grabbing their attention and forcing them to comprehend the text being presented. Jenny Holzer’s work, including the Truism series, has the same idea behind it and is equally as impactful. People are meant to see the words she writes in public spaces, shifting their consciousness from basic everyday thought to a critical and more thoughtful mindset. <br> <br>
        Any person existing in a post-WWII world understands that advertising is a central part of modern life. Especially in the United States, advertisements are everywhere, feeding the capitalist system that has become core to our political and social existences. There is no part of 21st century American life that advertising does not touch: it shapes the way we view ourselves, the way we view others, and the way we conceptualize the world around us. This is something that can be seen in Corita Kent’s piece Enriched Bread, which plays off the packaging and graphics of Wonder Bread’s design. The work is instantly recognizable as being inspired by that branding. Because advertisements are so prominent, artists have been able to capitalize upon the aesthetic possibilities involved in creating them. In this way, advertising has become a modern art form in its own right. The opportunities for what art can look like have increased exponentially in the last hundred years; our definition of what exactly “art” is has collectively shifted to be something more accessible, more monetizable, and arguably less personal. However, artists such as Jenny Holzer understand the complications involved with placing advertising in discourses with design. Female pop artists took the features that make advertising so effective (bold text, simple images, catchy slogans) and reclaimed them to create something much more personal and political, but with the same artistic ethos. The article "“Advertising Art That Advertises Itself As Art That Hates Advertising”: Jenny Holzer and the Truisms of Times Square" by S.S. Gumpert raises many interesting points about the interplay between advertising and art. <br> <br>
        According to Gumpert, Holzer understood that “Holzer has always been quite sensitive about how urban public space can and is being used.” The fact that advertising has overtaken American life makes it no surprise that it has also become central to public spaces. Holzer was concerned by the sight of public spaces meant for interaction between a diverse cross section of people becoming overtaken by corporate interests. The world is becoming at once more globalized and more isolated. As we become connected by the internet, public spaces are less important and seem to be slowly falling off, no doubt part of why advertising in these spaces is so common. <br> <br>
        It is also what makes public art installations such as Holzer’s so striking. With her art, she is able to take her concerns about rampant capitalism and turn them into pieces that can stand alone as both political statements and aesthetic masterpieces. It may seem unlikely to those under forty that at the time these female pop artists were beginning their careers, the technologies at their fingertips were new and far-fetched. With the amount of technological advancements that have been made in the last twenty years, particularly the tools that are now available to artists, what these women had to work with seems quite antiquated. Even so, it can tell us a lot about technology’s place in the art world, providing a road map as we venture into increasingly advanced technological territory. Before the invention of many technologies used in later works, Corita Kent solved the problem of creating typography by taking text and wrapping it around boxes to create a shape with dimension. She then photographed these pieces of text to create a flat image she could work from and incorporate into her final products. The techniques that pop artists used prove technology’s importance. This can be seen most clearly in Barbara Kruger’s work. The digitized text, edited images, and nature of the words she uses are features that could only exist in a modernizing world. They are indicative of the time in which she worked and early experimentation with technologies that have today become commonplace. The distribution of these women’s works is also very telling about technology’s role in art. <br> <br>
        The ability to quickly mass produce and distribute art makes it more accessible, letting the message of a particular work reach more people than it was ever previously able to.  It helped these women grow their careers and become art world legends, something they were well aware of and not afraid to make a commentary on. Each of these facts relating to technology and its relationship with pop art made it a perfect vehicle by which to practice political activism. Typography is uniquely linked to historical development, as humans have always imagined creative ways to hold power to account via artistry. The use of digitized typography specifically is a distinctly modern form of protest. It could not have been possible before technological developments like the printing press. this is something we might take for granted as it is so often seen, but it closely correlates to the technological developments that allowed art to be widely distributed in the first place. This is especially interesting in the era of social media, as youth’s idea of activism is text itself. Though we have transitioned from the bold and artistic text used in Corita Kent’s political work, the idea remains the same: slogans and typed language combined with image to convey some message to a broad audience. Social media at once makes political activism more accessible and causes messages to get lost. Art and design can allow one to advocate as prominently as possible, as striking or relevant design is a fantastic tool for effective distribution of a message. Female pop artists could not have foreseen this widening of the very issues they played off of in their work. However, the questions they were grappling with as both artists and activists are the same ones being raised by phenomena like social media activism today. <br> <br>
        Which kinds of art and design are effective forms of protest? When does a work become so mainstream that it loses its original message? How can image and typography be aesthetically interesting enough to be considered “art,” and when are they merely protest images? Looking back at the pop art of the 20th century gives us insight into how we might begin to answer these questions as we move further into the 21st century. As our world continues to shift both socially and artistically, we can always look back on the work of female pop artists for a comprehensive understanding of how we might navigate the modern world. Especially for women, the world is a place where commonplace living somehow extends into the world of the political and aesthetic conception of the world is tantamount. Though the 21st century has exacerbated these issues, they are not new. Female pop artists experienced the same things, and they were able to comment on it through a bold use of text. Artists as activists and activists as artists, women as advocates and advocates as women: these terms can be interchangeable, all one has to do is draw inspiration from the modern world and use the myriad of resources available to them, just as strongly worded female pop artists do.
