    <p>1. a) First semester of my sophomore year I took Core 1: Interaction class where I was first introduced to HTML/CSS/JS.
      <br>b) Since it was my first time introduced  to it, I found that anytime I made anything successfully work it was a win. And this would further my interest in continuing the work. 
      <br>c) The most confusing part was</p>

    <p>2. I am very excited about learning code, but at the same time have some hesiations just because I struggled through alot of the assignments I had last year. I'm looking forward to having a new professor and possibly a new way a learning it.</p>

    <p>3. I am still learing the opportunites coding can provide but I am interested in adapting coding as a tool into any surface level web design. I am also interested in AR, speciffically interesting in how it can be used in public and mural art.</p>

    <p>4. I have only had experience using Visual Studio Code as a text editor.</p> 

    <p>5. I breifly used GitHub last semester with our main project. I believe we only used it to create a usuable link to our site.</p>

    <p>6. HTML would be the blue prints of a house, it explained verbaly where everything is located and rooms relations to one another. CSS would be the visual componets to the house, the color of paint on the walls, any furniture or appliances in every room. Then JS is like the electrical and plumming of the house. It controls how you are able to interact and use the house.</p>
