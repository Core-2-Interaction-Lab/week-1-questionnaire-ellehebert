<p style="text-align: justify;">“It’s important to note that the tactic of recklessly painting over graffiti,
    which is generally uneven and mismatched in color, is more symbolic than practical. It sends a message 
    to writers in general, and the young people and communities (of color) where graffiti originated—that 
    their creative expression is not wanted, is of no value, and is therefore expendable.”  - Sidd Joag

    <br>
    In order to fully recognize and support the value of graffiti and street art as forms of social 
    commentary and community building, it is crucial to address the root causes of urban decay and 
    inequality. However, painting over graffiti without considering its artistic value or cultural 
    significance can actually do more harm than good. This tactic sends a message that artistic expression 
    and the communities where graffiti originated are not valued, which can further marginalize these 
    communities and create hostility towards authorities. Moreover, graffiti artists face additional 
    challenges such as vandalism and exploitation by corporations for profit. Therefore, it is important 
    to address these issues while supporting and celebrating their creative expression in public spaces. 
    By doing so, we can foster a more inclusive and vibrant urban landscape that reflects the diverse 
    voices and perspectives of our communities.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">“Graffiti is arguably the most relevant art form of our time. Yet, it is 
    attacked and destroyed where it is most accessible and where it is most at home. At the same time, it 
    is routinely commodified in the service of gentrification.”  - Sidd Joag
    <br>
    <br>
    Graffiti is a relevant and powerful art form that can connect people and communities through 
    self-expression and social commentary. However, it faces challenges like vandalism and exploitation 
    by corporations for profit. Graffiti artists rely on public spaces to showcase their work, but this 
    also makes their art vulnerable. The commodification of graffiti for gentrification is also 
    problematic. Supporting and celebrating graffiti artists is important, while addressing the challenges 
    they face.</p>
