<div class="grid-container6">
<div class="item6">“It’s important to note that the tactic of recklessly painting over graffiti,
        which is generally uneven and mismatched in color, is more symbolic than practical. It sends a message 
        to writers in general, and the young people and communities (of color) where graffiti originated—that 
        their creative expression is not wanted, is of no value, and is therefore expendable.”  - Sidd Joag</div>

<div class="grid-container7">
    <div class="item7">In order to fully recognize and support the value of graffiti and street art as forms of social 
        commentary and community building, it is crucial to address the root causes of urban decay and 
        inequality. However, painting over graffiti without considering its artistic value or cultural 
        significance can actually do more harm than good. This tactic sends a message that artistic expression 
        and the communities where graffiti originated are not valued, which can further marginalize these 
        communities and create hostility towards authorities. Moreover, graffiti artists face additional 
        challenges such as vandalism and exploitation by corporations for profit. Therefore, it is important 
        to address these issues while supporting and celebrating their creative expression in public spaces. 
        By doing so, we can foster a more inclusive and vibrant urban landscape that reflects the diverse 
        voices and perspectives of our communities.</div>

    <div class="item10">“Graffiti is arguably the most relevant art form of our time. Yet, it is 
        attacked and destroyed where it is most accessible and where it is most at home. At the same time, it 
        is routinely commodified in the service of gentrification.”  - Sidd Joag</div>

<div class="grid-container11">
    <div class="item11">    Graffiti is a relevant and powerful art form that can connect people and communities through 
        self-expression and social commentary. However, it faces challenges like vandalism and exploitation 
        by corporations for profit. Graffiti artists rely on public spaces to showcase their work, but this 
        also makes their art vulnerable. The commodification of graffiti for gentrification is also 
        problematic. Supporting and celebrating graffiti artists is important, while addressing the challenges 
        they face.
