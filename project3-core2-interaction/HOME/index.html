<!-- Introduction -->
<p>The map of graffiti tracking in NYC can help you explore the graffiti and street art scene in New York City. Keep in mind some 
    may view it as a form of artistic expression or cultural resistance, others see it as a light on public spaces that can contribute 
    to a sense of disorder and crime. It's important to approach the map of graffiti tracking with an open mind and consider the 
    broader social and cultural contexts that shape public attitudes towards this form of urban art. Graffiti is often highly 
    localized and can vary in intensity from one block to the next. It's important to corroborate the information you find on 
    the map with your own observations and those of your community.  It's a useful tool for discovering the city's street art 
    scene and discussing public space.</p>

        <h2>1966-71</h2>
        <p>NYC graffiti was initially used by activists and gangs, but its current identity formed in the late 1960s. 
            Graffiti's history begins in Philadelphia in the mid to late 1960s, where writers like CORNBREAD and TITY gained notoriety 
            by tagging their names all over the city. Although the Philadelphia movement predates NYC's, there's no direct connection 
            between the two. In NYC, the movement started independently around 1967 with JULIO 204 in the northernmost part of 
            Manhattan. He gained attention by writing his name on streets and subway stations in his neighborhood before retiring 
            after a short period.</p>

        <h2>1971-74</h2>
        <p>Following CORNBREAD and JULIO, Washington Heights gave birth to writers like TAKI, PHIL T GREEK, GREG 69, and others. TAKI, 
            a foot messenger, gained notoriety for his prolific tagging on subways and streets, and a 1971 New York Times article 
            on "TAKI 183 Spawns Penpals" sparked public curiosity. Meanwhile, Brooklyn also saw a growing movement with early 
            writers like FRIENDLY FREDDIE, UNDERTAKER ASH, and APP SUPER HOG. Writing moved from streets to subways, becoming a 
            unifying element for the separate movements and establishing inter-borough competition. Writers discovered the concept 
            and method of "bombing" by hitting many subway cars in train yards or lay-ups with less chance of getting caught.</p>

        <h2>Tag Style</h2>
        <p>With so many writers, fame was no longer just about volume, so they started developing unique tags and calligraphic 
            styles with flourishes, stars, and other designs to distinguish themselves. Crowns were used by writers who declared 
            themselves king..</p>

        <h2>1975-1977</h2>
        <p>Innovation in writing hit a plateau after 1974 and a new generation of writers began to reap the benefits of prior 
            artistic foundations and a fiscally challenged New York City transit system. This led to heavy bombing, where throw-ups 
            became the definitive form of bombing. Crews like POG, 3YB, BYB, TC, and TOP made major contributions, and throw-up kings 
            included TEE, IZ, DY 167, PI, IN, LE, TO, OI, FI aka VINNY, TI 149, CY, and PEO. The trend peaked from '75 through '77, as 
            did whole cars, and writers like BUTCH, CASE, KINDO, BLADE, COMET, ALE 1, DOO2, JOHN 150, KIT 17, MARK 198, LEE, MONO, 
            SLAVE, SLUG, DOC 109, and CAINE ONE plastered the IRTs with magnificent whole cars.</p>

        <h2>1978-1981</h2>
        <p>Graffiti art reached its peak in the late 1970s with crews like TDS, TMT, UA, CIA, and TF5. This was the last major wave of 
            graffiti before the Transit Authority made the elimination of graffiti a priority. The graffiti removal program, known as 
            The Buff, started up again in 1980 and many writers started to quit and consider other creative options. However, 
            established galleries like ESSES, Fashion Moda, and Fun Gallery proved to be important in expanding graffiti overseas. 
            European art dealers became aware of the movement and were receptive to the new art form. Exhibitions featuring 
            paintings by DONDI, LEE, ZEPHYR, LADY PINK, DAZE, FUTURA 2000 and others exposed the world to the once secret world of 
            New York's youth.</p>

        <h2>1982-1985</h2>
        <p>In the 1980s, the writing culture declined due to the crack cocaine epidemic, firearms, new laws, and the MTA's anti-graffiti 
            budget increase. The MTA made favored painting areas inaccessible and graffiti removal more consistent. This frustrated 
            some writers, while others became more aggressive and territorial, leading to cross-out wars and conflicts in yards and 
            lay-ups. Some writers still thrived during this time, including SKEME, DEZ, TRAP, DELTA, SHARP, SEEN TC5, SHY 147, BOE, 
            WEST, KAZE, SPADE 127, SAK, VULCAN, SHAME, BIO, MIN, DURO, KEL, T KID, MACK, NICER, BRIM, BG 183, KENN, CEM, FLIGHT, AIRBORN, 
            RIZE, JON 156, KYLE 156, and the X Men.</p>

          <h2>1985-1989</h2>
          <p>In the early to mid-1980s, several factors led to the deterioration of the writing culture, including the crack cocaine 
            epidemic, powerful firearms, and laws restricting the sale of paint to minors. The MTA's anti-graffiti budget increased 
            significantly, leading to tighter security and the removal of graffiti. However, on certain subway lines headed for scrap 
            yards, writers like WANE, WEN, DERO, and TKID took advantage of a last opportunity to hit white 5s with burners. Poor 
            artistic efforts were also made due to a lack of paint and courage to stay in a lay-up for prolonged periods of time, 
            and the violence subsided by mid-1986. Only a handful of diehard writers, such as GHOST, SENTO, and KET, remained 
            prominent figures to keep transit writing alive.</p>

          <h2>1989- PRESENT</h2>
          <p>On May 12, 1989 the MTA declared a victory over graffiti. The MTA set in effect a policy of removing all marked subway 
            cars from service. The objective being no graffiti will run. This was the birth of what is known as the Clean Train movement. 
            There are many writers who believe subway painting is the defining act in being a writer. Walls, freights, scraps, and 
            canvas are for fake writers. These writers refuse to give up the battle against the MTA. Even though works do not run or
            only run for one trip many people still write. Short list of clean train writers: COPE2, SENTO TFP, POEM, YES2Short list of
